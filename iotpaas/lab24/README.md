# PART THREE - HOT PATH

In this lab we will implement the hot path pattern in the reference architecture.
We will use Event Grid to push telemetry that is over a pre-defined threshold to a serverless function, which in turn will send an email to an operator with regards to the event.

There is not much here in this lab, but all the information is available online if you know where to look at.  
1. Start by selecting 'Events' in the IoT Hub menu.
2. Select Logic Apps
3. Go from there
